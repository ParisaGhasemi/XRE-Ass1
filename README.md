# Assignment 1: Make the Apple Fall Realistically üçé

### Objective
Your goal is to make the Apple prefab fall from a height and bounce realistically using Unity's physics engine.

<div style="max-width: 960px; margin: 0 auto;">
  <iframe
    src="https://parisaghasemi.github.io/XRE-Ass1/game/"
    width="960"
    height="600"
    allow="autoplay; fullscreen; xr-spatial-tracking"
    frameborder="0"
    style="width:100%; aspect-ratio: 16 / 10; border:0;"
  ></iframe>
</div>

### Steps
1. Open `Assets/Scenes/AppleScene.unity`.
2. Select the Apple prefab in the scene.
3. Add a Rigidbody component.
4. Adjust mass, drag, and collider settings for realism.
5. Make the apple fall and bounce once.
6. (Optional) Add ground friction or material.

### Deliverables
- Your modified Unity scene and assets (push them via GitHub).
- Optional: Include a screenshot or short video showing the apple falling.
- Optionally explain what you changed in this README file.

> Make sure to test the behavior in Play mode before submission!
